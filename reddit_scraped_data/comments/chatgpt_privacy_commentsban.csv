    I was wondering when this was going to happen. EU has pretty strict privacy protections for its citizens and I doubt that OpenAI is compliant with the requirements.

    [The Italian data-protection authority] said there was no legal basis to justify ""the mass collection and storage of personal data for the purpose of 'training' the algorithms underlying the operation of the platform"".

    They're definitely violating not just Italian privacy laws but EU privacy laws as well. Italy is the first domino to fall in Europe likely because the leadership there is most distrustful of AI.

    Some people around here don't seem to understand that this block is only until open AI complies with the EU regulations. Which they will eventually will. And things will go back to business as usual but within EU law. It happened several times in the past, no company ended up completely blocked in EU. At least not a major one that has a serious partnership with Microsoft.

    AI needs to be significantly regulated.

    Wow. As some guys are arguing now, “This is a huge overreach of AI’s civil rights.”

    It's weird how most comments are blaming or attacking the EU when this is Italy's fairly eurosceptic far right government doing this.
