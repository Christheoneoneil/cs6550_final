"Happened with Replika just a few weeks ago... It was also Italy initiating it.Happy to live in Switzerland lol. Our government wanted to adapt this law 1:1 but luckily we have a direct democracy and we got enough signatures for a referendum vote on it by the people. They wanted to make everyone provide an ID for age verification on ANY platform like Youtube etc. Even with older parts of the population it will not fly.  It added OpenAI does not verify the age of users and exposes ""minors to absolutely unsuitable answers compared to the their degree of development and self-awareness."" The same tactic they used with Replika. In the case of ChatGPT, I don't see any problems regarding that and it's just obvious that they misuse this part of the law."
" can only imagine being a startupper in Intaly. You found a great idea on the hot emerging market. You work day and night to make MVP, while others haven't done that. You understand that every day counts, and… SLAP! "
"Oh, great. So we get chatgpt/openai groupies now! Read through some of the comments around here and see how much uproar it has caused. ""Cavemen"", ""Italy has been irrelevant since blahblahblah"", ""bunch of losers"", ""lolz happy I live elsewhere"". C'mmon, hurl some more insults at Italy because they had the audacity to raise valid points and ask that Openai explain how they operate....I love chatgpt. I use it daily. It's fantastic. It's become second nature to me to run stuff through it. But I think Italy's doubts and concerns are NOT groundless. Let's see how they respond...Btw, banned? how banned? Is chatgpt not accessible in Italy the same way Google is not available or Facebook is not available in China? You are denied entry upon visiting the url?"
Why Italy has had a stagnant economy for decades.
OpenAI doesn't have an office in the EU but its representative in the European Economic Area has 20 days to communicate how it plans on bringing ChatGPT into compliance with EU privacy rules or face a penalty of up to 4 percent of its global revenue.
