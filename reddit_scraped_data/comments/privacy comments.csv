    You should have been concerned LONG before ChatGPT came around.

    Exactly, welcome to the internet.

    The internet has evolved for more than 30 years. People had no reasonable expectation that all their content would be scraped, retained, indexed, and regenerated nor was that economically feasible decades ago.
  
    I've been on networks since before the internet and run a home-based internet server for over 20 years. And I'm a big proponent of personal privacy, as evidenced by my other posts here.
  
    I am a little more optimistic about the possibility of unexpected, positive societal changes arising from growing awareness of privacy and ownership of one's own works because of ChatGPT and recent LLM AIs.

    The article makes good points, but none are exclusive to ChatGPT.
  
    Also mentioning Google's own chat bot, then continuing to criticize ChatGPT for things that most probably also apply to Google's, seems more than a little sneaky to me.
  
    From the article:
  
    
    OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, fed the tool some 300 billion words systematically scraped from the internet: books, articles, websites and posts – including personal information obtained without consent.
  
    If you’ve ever written a blog post or product review, or commented on an article online, there’s a good chance this information was consumed by ChatGPT.
  
    The data collection used to train ChatGPT is problematic for several reasons.
  
    First, none of us were asked whether OpenAI could use our data. This is a clear violation of privacy, especially when data are sensitive and can be used to identify us, our family members, or our location.
  
    Even when data are publicly available their use can breach what we call textual integrity. This is a fundamental principle in legal discussions of privacy. It requires that individuals’ information is not revealed outside of the context in which it was originally produced.
  
    Also, OpenAI offers no procedures for individuals to check whether the company stores their personal information, or to request it be deleted. This is a guaranteed right in accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – although it’s still under debate whether ChatGPT is compliant with GDPR requirements.
  
    This “right to be forgotten” is particularly important in cases where the information is inaccurate or misleading, which seems to be a regular occurrence with ChatGPT.
  
    Moreover, the scraped data ChatGPT was trained on can be proprietary or copyrighted.
  
  
    So, Big Data is bad. I am shocked!

    Thats the whole business model of every company that collects data on users. Facebook, Google, Apple, Micrsoft and more - all the companies that constantly track you partially in order to show you more relevant ads, they all use your data wayyyy out of context. they literally eavedrop on your conversations through your phone and then you suddenly get ads/recommendations based on your conversations - how is that not ""out of context"" ???

    Imagine: people can read whatever you posted online. ChatGPT is not the problem. Posting privat stuff online is the problem.
